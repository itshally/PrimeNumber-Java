# PrimeNumber-Java

A **prime number** (or a **prime**) is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. 


A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. 


For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1, involve 5 itself. 

However, 6 is composite because it is the product of two numbers (2 × 3) that are both smaller than 6.
